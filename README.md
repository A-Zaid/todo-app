# TO DO App

This application will help you to get more things done.

## To be done 

- Add unit tests
- Improve the user experience : eg. The search filters : 
   * Make it easier for the user to search for done/ not done todos
   * Use icons to update/ delete todos instead of buttons with text
   * Test it on different devices
 - Mock the API only on the dev environment
 - Deploy to production

## How to use it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
